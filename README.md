### How to Run:

3. Run the app using `python app.py`.
4. Open the app in a browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8050`.

### Dataset:
The app uses a cleaned dataset (`hot100_clean.csv`) derived from the Billboard Hot 100 and a previous list of Holiday songs features on the Billboard Hot 100 from 1958 - 2024 derived from kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sharkbait1223/billboard-top-100-christmas-carol-dataset.  
Data preparation includes renaming columns, handling missing values, and calculating new features like `year`, `decade`, and `is_december', filtering the Hot 100 data on the kaggle dataset and other Holiday keywords.
